## SECOM Data Set Information

A complex modern semi-conductor manufacturing process is normally under consistent surveillance via the monitoring of signals/variables collected from sensors and or process measurement points. However, not all of these signals are equally valuable in a specific monitoring system. The measured signals contain a combination of useful information, irrelevant information as well as noise. It is often the case  that useful information is buried in the latter two. Engineers typically have a much larger number of signals than are actually required. If we consider each type  of signal as a feature, then feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. The Process Engineers may then use these signals to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process. This will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs.

Numerical data are recorded values from a series of sensors in the production machines that are placed in specified locations to help identify the part of the production process which contributes to the faults.

## Objective
To minimize the rate at which faulty products leave the factory, the numerical data starts to make sense.

*   To enhance current business improvement techniques, we use feature selection techniques to rank features according to their impact on the overall yield for the product.

    *   Causal relationships may also be considered with a view to identifying the key features.
Dimensionality reduction techniques:

- Percent Missing Values
- Ammount of Variation
- Pairwise Correlation
- Correlation with Target
- Recursive feature elimination
